during the contest period. See <a href="http://hep.d2.comp.nus.edu.sg/challenges/all">all challenges</a></li>
        <li>Contestants can opt out of the contest permanently or temporarily. For example,
because of illness or because of a misplaced FitBit. They are to inform their House
reps, who will in turn inform the contest organizers. </li>
  <h5>Individual Contest</h5>
        <li>The individual winner shall be the contestant who completes the largest
number of challenges during the contest period.</li>
<h5>House Contest</h5>
        <li>Each contestant will accrue points for his/her House by completing
challenges. Each challenge will be worth a different number of points
depending on the perceived relative difficulty.</li>
        <li>The winning House will be the one which has the highest weighted average 
number of points accrued per participating House member. House members
who opt out of the contest temporarily for legitimate reasons will have their
