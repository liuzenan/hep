We have two apologies to make:

(i) We just noticed a typo in the email address for the technical help. It should be hep-support@googlegroups.com, NOT  hep-support@googlegroup.com (there was a missing 's'). This has obviously been corrected. If you had send email to ask for help earlier and felt ignored, we are so sorry about this mistake. We probably never received that email. Please send us email again if you have any issues to report. 

(ii) We had a server outage earlier this morning because someone accidentally unplugged the power supply. Because of that some of you might not have been able to change your challenges, and when you did, the system will reset. For today, you can send us email at hep-support@googlegroups.com if you had intended to change challenge and we will manually check if you fulfilled the challenges you had intended to do even if you didn't change in time. As long as the data is uploaded by your FitBit, we will be able to check your records and award you the achievements.

Once again, our apologies for these oversights. We ask for your kind understanding.
