We hope that this note finds you well and that the exams have gone well. 

The HEP Challenge is officially over today (5 May 2013)!

Our congratulations to Tiffany Bong and to House 10 for emerging as the individual and house winners for the official Challenge. Unofficially however, we believe that you are all winners for participating in this experiment/exercise to make you all more aware of your health and need to lead more active lives and sleep well. 

Because this is the first time that are doing this, there have been some kinks along the way and we ask for your kind understanding. We are currently in the midst of putting together a survey for the HEP in order to seek your feedback on how the Challenge could be improved in the future (if we decide to run one again). This whole experience has been interesting to us and we hope that you have had a good experience with HEP Challenge too. 

While the official Challenge is over, the HEP site will continue to remain open for the next few months. We hope that many of you will continue to use this platform as a means to push yourselves to be physically active and to remain healthy. 

The summer vacations are around the corner. Stay well and remain healthy!
