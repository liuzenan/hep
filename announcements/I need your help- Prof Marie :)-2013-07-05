Dear all,

I hope you are still enjoying your vacation time. I would like to take few minutes of this time to complete the HEP Challenge Survey. We are planning for the next phase I batch and your feedback is really critical at this stage. I need all opinions. Those who did not like it, those who are neutral and those who enjoyed it and find it useful. Do not let us run a program for the second time if the majority of you think it is a waste of time and effort :). I really count on you.

Regards

Marie
