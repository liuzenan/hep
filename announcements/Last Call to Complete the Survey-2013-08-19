Hi everyone,

As mentioned this morning, we only had 72 responses from 300 of you after 3 reminders. OK, fine, perhaps it was just very inopportune because it was the holiday period and people were busy. I am pleased to note that we now have 98 responses in the system, so quite a few have responded since this morning, But at our current numbers, some 2/3(!) still have not responded. :-(

This is my final appeal to you to cooperate with Marie and to let her have your feedback. This FitBit Challenge is not some cheap enterprise. The Medical School has spent some 300 x USD100 to make it happen. Moving forward, Marie needs to have a good picture of exactly what's happened and what people think, so that your faculty can decide if it wants to do this again next year for the new freshmen, and if so, in what form. 

As mentioned, this survey thing will have no bearing whatsoever on your future or your studies. There is really no real good reason to do this, except that it would be a decent thing to do, given that Marie is such a sweet lady and that she has worked really hard to make this happen. 

It has been a pleasure doing this little experiment with you. Hope that at least some of you have found it helpful. I wish you all the very best in your studies at the medical school. Thanks!

Warmest Regards,

Ben
