Hi,

Congratulations on completing your first year of medical school. We hope that the exams have gone well.

Thank you for participating in the HEP challenge. We are currently in the process of evaluating the outcomes of the HEP Challenge to decide if we should conduct it again next year and if so, whether we should do it differently. 

In this light, we would be very grateful if you can take some time to provide us with your feedback at this online survey:

Warmest Regards,

HEP Team
P.S. If you click on the link and you find that you cannot login with your FitBit id, do not panic. Do try again later. It seems that the FitBit site is experiencing intermittent some issues which is not under our control. Facebook login seems to be working fine.
